# Chunked Backend

This repository is connected to the [Image-to-Video](https://github.com/minettebrink/image-to-video) project. I experimented with the backend and made some modifications:

- Implemented an alternative method to download the model from Hugging Face.
- Updated the `Dockerfile` to try different ways to download the model.
